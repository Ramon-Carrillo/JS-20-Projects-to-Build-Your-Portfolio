Here is the truth: It's easy to find JavaScript projects to work on online. You can copy and paste code. You can watch YouTube videos. That's simple *(and free)*. This course is different in that not only de we have modern projects using the latest features of JavaScript, and browser APIs, **but we also do a Code Review of each project. **After we build a website, we go through the code and talk about how we can improve the code, how to improve the security, or improve the performance of your projects.

**It's like having a senior developer finally teach you what good code means, what are the common mistakes beginners make, and how to  write maintainable code.**

All code is going to be provided to you, and even if you don't like to code along, you will get access to the code for the projects to put them on your portfolio right away.
